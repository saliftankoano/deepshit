# DeepShit MCP Code Critic Server - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Product Overview

### Vision

Create an intelligent MCP server that provides contextual code criticism and improvement suggestions to AI agents during code generation, enhancing code quality and helping achieve user goals through iterative feedback loops.

### Mission

Bridge the gap between AI-generated code and production-ready code by providing intelligent, context-aware criticism that helps AI agents learn and improve their output quality.

### Product Name

**DeepShit MCP Code Critic** (leveraging DeepSeek-R1 for intelligent analysis)

## 2. Target Users

### Primary Users

- **AI Agents** (Claude, GPT-4, etc.) operating in IDEs like Cursor
- **Developers** using AI-assisted coding tools who want higher quality output

### User Personas

1. **AI Agent**: Needs structured feedback to improve code generation
2. **Developer**: Wants better AI-generated code that requires less manual review
3. **Development Teams**: Seeking consistent code quality standards

## 3. Problem Statement

### Current Pain Points

- AI-generated code often requires significant manual review and refactoring
- No systematic way for AI agents to learn from code quality feedback
- Lack of context-aware code criticism that understands user goals
- Generic linting tools don't provide intelligent alternatives
- No feedback loop between code generation and quality improvement

### Success Metrics

- **Code Quality Score**: Measurable improvement in generated code quality
- **Developer Satisfaction**: Reduced time spent on manual code review
- **Adoption Rate**: Number of active MCP server integrations
- **Revenue Growth**: Subscription and usage-based monetization

    // How well code matches user goals
    alignment_score: number;
    goal_analysis: string;
    recommendations: string[];
  };
}

interface Issue {
  type: "security" | "performance" | "maintainability" | "readability";
